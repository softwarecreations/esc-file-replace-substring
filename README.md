# esc-file-replace-substring
Replace (with option to append) string or RegEx in a file, if different vs old contents (SSD/flash memory friendly).

## Project goals
* No dependencies
* No nonsense
* Reliable, no radical changes will ever happen.
* Small, simple, easy to audit, yourself

If I have ideas for something different, I'll make a new package rather than make breaking changes.
